Problem Description

Given a bitonic sequence A of N distinct elements, write a program to find a given element B in the bitonic sequence in O(logN) time.

NOTE:

A Bitonic Sequence is a sequence of numbers which is first strictly increasing then after a point strictly decreasing.

First find the bitonic element in the array in log(N) time

And now in the two arrays seperated by bitionic point search the element
