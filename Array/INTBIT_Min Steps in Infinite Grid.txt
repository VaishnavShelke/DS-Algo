Problem Description

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions

(x,y) to
(x-1, y-1),
(x-1, y) ,
(x-1, y+1),
(x , y-1),
(x , y+1),
(x+1, y-1),
(x+1, y) ,
(x+1, y+1)
You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points.. 
Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

My Approach:
  I had completely misunderstood the problem, but the problem statement essentially is that given a point start_1 I have to reach end_1 in minimum steps
  { Diagonally, Vertically and Horizontally}.
  So the solution is very easy, always take the shortest path which can be vertical X ,
  horizontal Y or Diagonal X or Y  or can be combination of any two { Diagonal + Vertical / Diagonal + Horizontal }.
  But in any case we have to move at least the maximum of (X,Y) even is shortest path is taken.
