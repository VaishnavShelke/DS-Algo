Given a list of non negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

For example:

Given [3, 30, 34, 5, 9], the largest formed number is 9534330.

Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.


Best Approach {Not Mine}
    We know that we have to sort the array, but based on what parameter ???
    Let us take for example our array is 9, 98 ...

My approach to do it;
  Make the length of both the numbers by appending 9's to the end of the shorter
  Compare them both...

Interview Bit approach;
  compare '9'+'98' and '98'+'9'
