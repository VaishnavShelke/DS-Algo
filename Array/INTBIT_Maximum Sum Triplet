Problem Description

Given an array A containing N integers.

You need to find the maximum sum of triplet ( Ai + Aj + Ak ) such that 0 <= i < j < k < N and Ai < Aj < Ak.

If no such triplet exist return 0.

My Approach:
  was similar to the approach given in the hint section but it was doing the same thing in more complicated way.
  So although my intuition was correct, but i will prefer hint approach over my approach.
  
  what it wanted to say is that for every index i_index save the minimum element until i_index-1 and
  maximum element after i_index + 1;
  
  After this activity is done check 
  if( minim[i] < arr[i] && maxim[i] > arr[i])
    store_maxSum = max( store_maxSum, minim[i] + arr[i] + maxim[i])
    
  Hence our solution is found
