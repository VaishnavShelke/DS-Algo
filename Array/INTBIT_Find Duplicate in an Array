Given a read only array of n + 1 integers between 1 and n, find one number that repeats in linear time using less than O(n) space and traversing the stream sequentially O(1) times.

Sample Input:

[3 4 1 4 1]
Sample Output:

1
If there are multiple possible answers ( like in the sample case above ), output any one.

If there is no duplicate, output -1


Interview Bit Approach:
      we use space less than O(N)
      we use linear time complexity
      
      Approach:
          Keep the count of all the elements that lie in range of n*sqrt(N) and n+1*sqrt(N)
          This counter will require sqrt(N) space.
          
          If any of them overflows check the count of frequency of the elements in the main array
          using hash
