You are given two integers n and m. Calculate the number of pairs of arrays (a,b) such that:

1. the length of both arrays is equal to m;
2. each element of each array is an integer between 1 and n (inclusive);
3. aiâ‰¤bi for any index i from 1 to m;
4. array a is sorted in non-descending order;
5. array b is sorted in non-ascending order.
As the result can be very large, you should print it modulo 109+7.


Arrange both arrays as
  A1 , A2 , A3 .... Am , Bm , Bm-1 , ..... B1
  
Now the above sequences should be ascending or stagnant
To satisfy both the condition  3,4,5

Now we have to place n-1 bars in 2*m + n - 1 boxes 
the boxes between two bars represent the number of digits of same type....
Therefore answer is .... C( 2*m + n -1, n-1 )
