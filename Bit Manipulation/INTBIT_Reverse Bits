Problem Description

Reverse the bits of an 32 bit unsigned integer A.



Problem Constraints
0 <= A <= 232



Input Format
First and only argument of input contains an integer A.



Output Format
Return a single unsigned integer denoting the decimal value of reversed bits.


My Approach:
    Given Number : 10100010001111
    To output the reverse we initialize a number as reverCe = 00000000000000;
    now while(Number){
    reverCe <<= 1;
    reverCe = reverCe | ( Number & 1 );
    Number >>= 1;
    }
